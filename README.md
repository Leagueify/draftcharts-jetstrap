# draftcharts-jetstrap

This is a site that shows draft values for Alma maters, made with Jetstrap and to test Azure's auto-deployment from Github.

Check out the site at [draftcharts.azurewebsites.net](http://draftcharts.azurewebsites.net).

Some of these charts are made with [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com), so some of the alternative and historical charts are available on Ross's public profile [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/rosslarson#!/).
