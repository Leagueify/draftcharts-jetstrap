# draftcharts-jetstrap

This is a site that shows draft values for Alma maters, initially made with [Jetstrap](https://jetstrap.com/) (an old product from the folks who make the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/)) and to test Azure's auto-deployment from Github.

Check out the site at [draftcharts.azurewebsites.net](http://draftcharts.azurewebsites.net).

Some of these charts are made with Google Sheets, Google Charts, and [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com), so some of the alternative and historical charts are available on Ross's public profile [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/rosslarson#!/).

Care about football and want to talk about draft resources? Add some information on the [wiki](https://github.com/Leagueify/draftcharts-jetstrap/wiki)!
